* **Rules**
* One player will select a theme card at random while the remaining 3 players will select 3 noun cards at random.
* The players that selected noun cards will select one of the 3 cards they have and give that card to the player to their left. The player that selected the theme card will not recieve a noun card.
* Each player will have 1 minute to negotiate how their noun card has the most resemblance to the selected theme card.
* Once the players time is up they may not speak until the round is over.
* After each player pleads their case to the theme selector, the theme selector will now decide which player negotiated the best.
* Whichever player negotiated the best will recieve one point.
* The first player to achieve 5 points will be the winner.
